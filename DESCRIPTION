Description: These functions are used in John Bullock's code; they are 
  typically needed for replication purposes. They range in complexity from a 
  function that removes NA values from a vector prior to summing it 
  (sumNA) to a trio of functions that produce well-formatted regression-table
  output (regTable, latexTable, and latexTablePDF).
