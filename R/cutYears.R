#' Transform a vector of year values into an ordered factor of year groups.
#'
#' This function is a wrapper around \linkInt{cut}. Given a vector of 
#' strings or integers that represent years, and a vector of breakpoints, it
#' returns a factor in which each level represents a group of years. Unlike 
#' \code{cut()}, it returns pretty labels for the levels: "1975-79" instead 
#' of "[1975,1980)", and so on. Also unlike \code{cut()}, it ensures that 
#' all of the data are accounted for in the levels of the factor that it 
#' creates: data will never be dropped from a factor that \code{cutYears()}
#' returns.
#' 
#' By default, \code{cutYears()} differs from \code{cut()} in the following 
#' ways:
#' 
#' * Accepts only `x` vectors in which every value has four characters or 
#'   four digits.
#' * Returns a factor that has better labels for groups of years: for 
#'   example, "1975-80" rather than "\[1975,1980)".
#' * Returns factor levels that encompass all values of `x`. Consequently, 
#'   `cutYears()` will never convert year values to `NA`, as `cut()` will 
#'   often do. 
#' * Returns an ordered factor by default.
#' * By default, `cutYears()` drops levels that are outside the bounds
#'   of `x`. For example, if `x` ranges from 1975 to 1985, the factor 
#'   returned by `cut()` may have an infinite number of levels, including,
#'   say, "(1900-1905]". (The exact levels returns by `cut()` depend on the 
#'   arguments passed to it, especially the `breaks` argument.) But in a 
#'   case like this, the lowest factor level returned by `cutYears()` will
#'   include 1975, and the highest factor level returned by `cutYears()` 
#'   will contain 1985.
#' @md 


#' @param x Vector of four-digit integers, or of four-character strings 
#' that can be converted to integers, e.g., "1900".
#' 
#' @param breaks Numeric vector of cutpoints
#' 
#' @param levelsBoundedByData Logical. Ensures that the lowest and highest 
#' levels of the returned factor will contain some data. Also ensures that
#' the label for the highest factor level reports the maximum year in 
#' \code{x}, rather than a higher year.
#' 
#' @param shortLabels Logical. If \code{FALSE}, the second year in each 
#' label will always have four digits: for example, "1975-1999". If
#' \code{TRUE} (the default), the second year in each label will typically 
#' have two digits: for example, "1975-99". But even if \code{shortLabels}
#' is \code{TRUE}, the second year in a label will have four digits if it 
#' isn't in the same century as the first year. For example, 
#' \code{cutYears()} will always produce a label like "1975-2001" instead of
#' "1975-01".
