Version 1.10.  Added lsos() to the package.
Version 1.09.  Adjusted merge_fac() so that it can work with variables in 
               environments other than the global environment. 
Version 1.08.  Added stack utilities (push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift()) 
               that are based on Jeffrey A. Ryan's code at
               http://www.lemnica.com/esotericR/Introducing-Closures/.
Version 1.07.  Fixed bug in latable() handling of ivreg() output.  (The AER
               package contains an ivreg() function for instrumental-variables
               regression.)
Version 1.06.  Added "rows.to.remove" argument to latable() so that 
               latable() can return "incomplete" regression tables.
Version 1.05.  Added NAMESPACE to make the Windows binary installable in R 2.14.
Version 1.04.  Added reliability() to compute Cronbach's alpha for batteries of survey items or other measurements.
Version 1.03.  Added modal_value() and fixed a related bug in move.to.df().
