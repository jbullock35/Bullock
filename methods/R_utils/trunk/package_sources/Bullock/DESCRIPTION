Description: functions that help me do miscellaneous tasks a little more
  quickly.  These range in complexity from a function that just removes NA 
  values from a vector prior to summing it (sumNA) to a function that helps me 
  to build LaTeX tables from regression output in the style that I like 
  (latable).
